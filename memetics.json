        "You draw a 2D object and magically reconstitute it into its real, 3D representation. The spell may convert a drawing covering no more than 25 sq feet into a real, mundane object or terrain featureâ€”such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons. When the spell is cast on a drawing it becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond and painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit. Doorways may extend through at most 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. Pits will always extend down 10 feet before stopping, regardless of the actual depth of the floor they're drawn on.",
        "Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.",
        "If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy deals {@damage 1d8} damage of the appropriate type to creatures within 5ft of the energy. The energy then dissipates."
