You must be clear about the specific goal you want to achieve. For example, shouting that \"The Church of Reostadt is evil and corrupt!\" might make people dislike the church, but it won't spur them to action because it doesn't tell them what to do. Adding \"Follow me, and we'll burn it to the ground!\" will send a crowd of torch-bearing arsonists to Xanathar himself.",

If these conditions aren't met, the spell ends and the crowd becomes hostile toward you. The spell also ends when the goal has been achieved. If the goal is achieved or the duration ends naturally, those under the affect of the spell do not realize they were charmed by you."

The spell may convert a drawing covering no more than 25 sq feet into a real, mundane object or terrain featureâ€”such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons. When the spell is cast on a drawing it becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond and painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit. Doorways may extend through at most 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. Pits will always extend down 10 feet before stopping, regardless of the actual depth of the floor they're drawn on.",
